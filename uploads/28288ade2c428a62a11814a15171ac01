26/11/2017, 18:08 - The Dark Knight: Bhai log bolte h milne. Plans bnta h. Then I ditch.
Meri aadat h yeh.
I mean until and unless they're someone very close to me, I just can't go and meet.
Try krta hu less human interaction hoe. (Hard to believe, but I do.).
26/11/2017, 18:09 - The Dark Knight: Example Kajal.
Woh office m bhi boli thi pehle milne. Maine bola "sure.". Then I ditched. 😅.
26/11/2017, 18:09 - Abdul Bhaiya: Badey log!

26/11/2017, 21:34 - Abdul Bhaiya: For some strange reason I never felt ki she looked aged.
26/11/2017, 21:34 - The Dark Knight: I always felt. 😝.
26/11/2017, 21:35 - Abdul Bhaiya: But definitely got a lot of reviews from other people that she looks aged.
26/11/2017, 21:36 - Abdul Bhaiya: Tab bhi you were like isse shadi karu ga?
Hahaha😂😂😂
26/11/2017, 21:38 - The Dark Knight: I was very skeptical.
Honestly btau th mujhe mujhse badi ladkiyan achhi lagti h. But I never imagined myself marrying one. 😝.
Iske case m (later on, not initially) I was like "Chalo thik h. Koi nhi. Character k samne age/looks doesn't matter.".
26/11/2017, 21:38 - Abdul Bhaiya: Wo pic jo maine tujhe bheji h conversation wali us me dekh, although I said ki teri sis but she was lik haan mai haas nhi paa rahi thi.

26/11/2017, 21:56 - Abdul Bhaiya: IMG-20171126-WA0022.jpg (file attached)
26/11/2017, 21:56 - Abdul Bhaiya: To understand this also you gotta see that.
26/11/2017, 21:57 - The Dark Knight: Bro, woh aapko chutiya wala reply maar rhi h. Jalane k liye nhi bol rha hu.
Now I understand why you're getting bored.
26/11/2017, 21:58 - The Dark Knight: I mean late reply m agar koi sirf "Okay" likhe th kya conclusion niklega?!
26/11/2017, 21:58 - Abdul Bhaiya: It’s because of my late replies I guess.
26/11/2017, 21:59 - The Dark Knight: Seems plausible. 👍🏻.
26/11/2017, 22:00 - The Dark Knight: Kya lagta h abhi reply aaega uska? 😝.
26/11/2017, 22:00 - Abdul Bhaiya: Although That ok came after that reply  (kaha wali pic h)
But she haven’t seen it.
26/11/2017, 22:01 - Abdul Bhaiya: Mistry!
26/11/2017, 22:01 - The Dark Knight: *Mystery.
26/11/2017, 22:01 - Abdul Bhaiya: So I believe wo ok was okay.
26/11/2017, 22:02 - Abdul Bhaiya: Rofl 🤣 
Dictionary ne dhokha de diya.
😅😅😅
26/11/2017, 22:02 - The Dark Knight: Hmm, even I got bored chat padh k. 😅.
Forced conversation bina matlab ka.
26/11/2017, 22:03 - The Dark Knight: Full stop wala conversation dikhao mujhe. 😂.
26/11/2017, 22:03 - Abdul Bhaiya: IMG-20171126-WA0023.jpg (file attached)
26/11/2017, 22:04 - Abdul Bhaiya: IMG-20171126-WA0024.jpg (file attached)
26/11/2017, 22:04 - Abdul Bhaiya: Same same.
🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
26/11/2017, 22:06 - The Dark Knight: Okay. I need to teach you this one thing.


Never ever. I mean NEVER EVER ask anyone while texting "There?","I'm waiting for your reply?","????",other synonymous impatient remarks. That's a turn off, bro.

I thought bta du taki future m kaam aye. 😝.
26/11/2017, 22:06 - The Dark Knight: Hum janmooch k wahi statement likha aapko because you showed me that screenshot before. :p.
26/11/2017, 22:09 - Abdul Bhaiya: Oh that’s why my brain played tricks on me ki - isne ye kaha tha wahi dekh kr reply bheja tha but ager dekh kr bheja tha toh why is he asking to send that pic again. So I thought maine nhi bheji hogi.
26/11/2017, 22:10 - The Dark Knight: Arre I didn't notice ki usime full stops ka upayog hua h.
26/11/2017, 22:11 - Abdul Bhaiya: I know it but for some reason I asked it which I don’t remember now why I showed that desperate ness.
26/11/2017, 22:13 - The Dark Knight: Okay okay.
But next time se kisi doosri ladki pe nhi use krna.

It portrays clingy behavior. 😅.

Remember: We chase what retreats from us.

Human mind, bro.
26/11/2017, 22:13 - Abdul Bhaiya: Pagal.
26/11/2017, 22:13 - Abdul Bhaiya: Okay 👌🏻.
26/11/2017, 22:14 - Abdul Bhaiya: Dinner ho gaya?
26/11/2017, 22:15 - Abdul Bhaiya: Not so experienced in chatting.
26/11/2017, 22:15 - The Dark Knight: Ye line: "We chase from retreats from us.". mereko mere gurudev ne sikhaya. College m.
26/11/2017, 22:16 - The Dark Knight: *that what
26/11/2017, 22:16 - The Dark Knight: *what.
26/11/2017, 22:16 - The Dark Knight: 😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝
26/11/2017, 22:16 - Abdul Bhaiya: ??
🤔🤔
26/11/2017, 22:17 - The Dark Knight: Line galat type ho gyi thi. 😅.
26/11/2017, 22:17 - Abdul Bhaiya: I’ll also keep this in my mind.
26/11/2017, 22:18 - Abdul Bhaiya: Konsi wali?
26/11/2017, 22:18 - The Dark Knight: It works. Trust me.
But is ladki pe nhi. I mean we're retreating and this is what she'll not want. But future ladki jo "achhi" ho uspe use krna.
26/11/2017, 22:19 - Abdul Bhaiya: Got it.
26/11/2017, 22:19 - The Dark Knight: "We chase..." wali.
26/11/2017, 22:19 - The Dark Knight: Chalo bro. I'll go now.
26/11/2017, 22:20 - The Dark Knight: Good night.
26/11/2017, 22:20 - Abdul Bhaiya: Kaha?
Chal mai b jata hu dinner k liye.
26/11/2017, 22:20 - The Dark Knight: Padhne.
26/11/2017, 22:20 - The Dark Knight: Ha okay.
26/11/2017, 22:20 - The Dark Knight: Bye.
26/11/2017, 22:20 - Abdul Bhaiya: Okay 👌🏻
26/11/2017, 22:20 - Abdul Bhaiya: Bye.👋🏻👋🏻
26/11/2017, 22:21 - The Dark Knight: 👋🏻
26/11/2017, 22:54 - Abdul Bhaiya: Bro I am real introvert.
I just realised that I can’t make a good conversation.
Which really makes me clingy.
26/11/2017, 22:54 - Abdul Bhaiya: Had couple of thought now.
26/11/2017, 22:56 - Abdul Bhaiya: Which made me realised that ki bechari Pooja was suffering and some how managed to keep up with our boring relationship.
26/11/2017, 22:57 - Abdul Bhaiya: One sided conversation she was having as I was not able to make a good conversation.
26/11/2017, 22:57 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😔😔😔
26/11/2017, 22:58 - Abdul Bhaiya: Man gotta improve this skill but I wonder how can I do that?
🤔🤔🤔
26/11/2017, 22:59 - Abdul Bhaiya: If you have any ideas then please shoot them.
26/11/2017, 22:59 - Abdul Bhaiya: I guess periods are taking over.
26/11/2017, 23:00 - Abdul Bhaiya: Making me depress.
26/11/2017, 23:02 - Abdul Bhaiya: Wondering ki next wali ager bani toh how am I going to sustain it.
26/11/2017, 23:02 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😔😔😔
26/11/2017, 23:03 - Abdul Bhaiya: *sustain the relationship.
26/11/2017, 23:05 - Abdul Bhaiya: Yes obviously.
26/11/2017, 23:05 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😝😝😝
26/11/2017, 23:05 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😔😔
26/11/2017, 23:06 - The Dark Knight: Lol. 😂.
26/11/2017, 23:06 - Abdul Bhaiya: I thought tu daba kr padh raha hoga.
26/11/2017, 23:06 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😔😔
26/11/2017, 23:09 - Abdul Bhaiya: And that’s why she was desperately looking for some other person.
And then she found you.
And she started cheating.
I guess problem is with me not her.😔😔😔😔
26/11/2017, 23:09 - The Dark Knight: Bro, I'll admit ki one needs to be interesting during conversation in a relationship. Not everyday will be the same. But overall a couple is supposed to have intellectually stimulating conversation.

Pooja escapes as a "good conversationalist" by mentioning minute irrelevant details, thus making you look like a "stupid conversationalist".

Else, I feel you've a lot to offer to a conversation.
Dheere dheere you'll learn to text. :p.

But, of course, is ladki pe nhi. 🙏🏻.
26/11/2017, 23:10 - The Dark Knight: Laura type over thinking mat karo.
26/11/2017, 23:12 - Abdul Bhaiya: Pata nhi yaar.
Period h shayed.
26/11/2017, 23:14 - Abdul Bhaiya: Wo dheere dheere kab hoga I wonder and also kaise I’ll learn if I was not able to judge my conversation, as I will be biased with my conversation itself.
26/11/2017, 23:14 - The Dark Knight: Aap m koi kami nhi h.
Bas needy mat bnna next time ladki k saath. Once in a blue moon chalta h. But kabhi ye "Tu meri zindagi h" types conversation mat krna. 😝. Thoda turn off ho jaega because that makes you look like a submissive guy.
Again, kabhi k baar chalta h.

Also refrain from using lot of emojis. For instance a "Good morning", is supposed to be just a "Good morning.". No emoji and all.
Kabhi k baar emoji daalo because agar kisi cheez ki aadat lag gyi then samne wale ko kadar nhi rehti.
26/11/2017, 23:16 - Abdul Bhaiya: Okay.
26/11/2017, 23:16 - The Dark Knight: The participation of your conversation is not worthy enough to be benchmarked against. Because dono side se forced tha.
So, chill, bro.
26/11/2017, 23:17 - Abdul Bhaiya: Started Restraining myself from using emojis.
(Ye wala👌🏻as a start)
26/11/2017, 23:17 - The Dark Knight: Mummy se baat kr rha tha. Th rakhte waqt aapka message dekha th poocha if it's safe to be online.
But I'll make a move now. 😅.
26/11/2017, 23:18 - Abdul Bhaiya: Which move?
26/11/2017, 23:18 - The Dark Knight: Hmm. Extra emojis are for stupid teenagers, bro.
We're grown ups. So better act like one.
26/11/2017, 23:18 - The Dark Knight: Chalo bye.
Itna bolne k liye aya.
26/11/2017, 23:20 - Abdul Bhaiya: Okay kal chatuga tujhe.
Tujhe b toh pata chale ki Pooja kya face kr rahi thi so she decided to cheat.
😝😝
26/11/2017, 23:20 - Abdul Bhaiya: Chal padh le tu.
Tata
26/11/2017, 23:21 - The Dark Knight: No, man.
On a serious note.
I'll actually lessen my time in WhatsApp now.
But ha, Tuesday tak apne ko sync m rehna h. 😝.
So, cool.
26/11/2017, 23:21 - The Dark Knight: Bye. (Final.).
26/11/2017, 23:24 - Abdul Bhaiya: Chal good night mai ludak jata hu.
And yes I’ll definitely start reducing our conversation so you can get more time to study.
27/11/2017, 06:46 - Abdul Bhaiya: Uth gayi aunty aur 6-05 me hi good morning wish kr diya.
Avoiding her today.
Not gonna reply today.
27/11/2017, 06:56 - The Dark Knight: Sahi h. 😂.
27/11/2017, 06:58 - Abdul Bhaiya: Just being online for no reason.
So that she feels ki mai online hu aur kahi aur hi setting kr raha hu.
27/11/2017, 06:59 - Abdul Bhaiya: And I remembered why I was desperately typed der?
Because of the same shit, bring her online and start avoiding.
27/11/2017, 07:03 - Abdul Bhaiya: Mera jo depression chal raha h iss chiz ko leke ki she is cheating on me with my closest friend goes down if I think from my head and realise that ki wo itni khubsurat b nhi h jo mai itnA roo raha hu.
27/11/2017, 07:04 - Abdul Bhaiya: <Media omitted>
27/11/2017, 07:07 - The Dark Knight: Puking wali feeling ati h ye video dekh k. 😝.
27/11/2017, 07:07 - The Dark Knight: Actually m sahi h woh.
27/11/2017, 07:08 - The Dark Knight: Isko video ko dekh k darr sach m lagta h ki kaise andhe ho rhe the humlog. :p.
27/11/2017, 07:08 - Abdul Bhaiya: Bro aisa b mat bol.
27/11/2017, 07:09 - The Dark Knight: Ha ha. 😅.
27/11/2017, 07:09 - Abdul Bhaiya: Lol 😂.
True ye chalega.
27/11/2017, 07:09 - Abdul Bhaiya: *. Ye
27/11/2017, 07:10 - The Dark Knight: Mei thodi der padh leta hu bhaiya.
Mujhe achha nhi lag rha h ki mei late uth gya. Sala yaad bhi nhi alarm bja bhi tha ki nhi.
27/11/2017, 07:11 - Abdul Bhaiya: Ankey kholne wala video h ye, that’s for sure.
27/11/2017, 07:11 - The Dark Knight: Yep.
27/11/2017, 07:12 - The Dark Knight: :p.
27/11/2017, 07:12 - Abdul Bhaiya: Haan padh le.
Mai thukne jaa raha hu. 😂😂😂
27/11/2017, 07:12 - The Dark Knight: Cool. And Shrishti se talk.
27/11/2017, 07:13 - The Dark Knight: Today you've got a lot to do.
27/11/2017, 07:13 - Abdul Bhaiya: Yes. aj toh odc me ghus kr baat krne ka plan h.
27/11/2017, 07:13 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😎😎😎
27/11/2017, 07:13 - The Dark Knight: Krlo. It's needed. But one doubt.
27/11/2017, 07:14 - Abdul Bhaiya: Ya shoot.
27/11/2017, 07:15 - The Dark Knight: Tomorrow she'll be coming to PSN.
I'll be at PSN as well.

Usko inorbit leke jana hoga. I'm not sure ye sahi hoga ki nhi. Because what if she refuses and is like "Nhi. Let's go to Park Square.".
27/11/2017, 07:15 - Abdul Bhaiya: Hmmm 🤔 .
27/11/2017, 07:16 - The Dark Knight: Sochke btao. 😅.
27/11/2017, 07:17 - Abdul Bhaiya: Bolna park square acha nhi lagta.
If she doesn’t convinced by that then there will be change of plan from my end. And I try to bring her there.
27/11/2017, 07:18 - Abdul Bhaiya: *i’ll
27/11/2017, 07:19 - The Dark Knight: Okay. Because I'm pretty sure she'll refuse going to inorbit. Bht door h PSN se bhai. 😝.
27/11/2017, 07:19 - Abdul Bhaiya: Kuch jada hi umeedey laga rahki h sristi se.
I wonder what if she says bhag.🤔🤔🤔
27/11/2017, 07:20 - The Dark Knight: Then th paise. 😂.
27/11/2017, 07:22 - Abdul Bhaiya: But aisi kon miley gi jo paiso se maan jayegi?
27/11/2017, 07:23 - Abdul Bhaiya: In that case plan will be postpone till I get a real GF.
27/11/2017, 07:24 - Abdul Bhaiya: Which I guess will take forever.
27/11/2017, 07:24 - The Dark Knight: But mei th Tuesday hi. 🙏🏻.

27/11/2017, 07:26 - Abdul Bhaiya: Rofl.

27/11/2017, 07:27 - The Dark Knight: But woh help kr degi.
Guess what?!
27/11/2017, 07:28 - Abdul Bhaiya: Hmm let’s keep her for the worst case scenario.
27/11/2017, 07:28 - The Dark Knight: I was going to comment on that.

Not good + no ass.
Reminds someone?! 😝.
27/11/2017, 07:28 - Abdul Bhaiya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
27/11/2017, 07:29 - The Dark Knight: But jee jaan lga do aap Shrishti ko bolne m.

Agar aaj bhi chutiyap chalta h th I'll depart early from PSN and Global Axis aa jaunga.
27/11/2017, 08:22 - Abdul Bhaiya: Okay.
27/11/2017, 08:23 - The Dark Knight: "'On' ho ya 'in'.
Communicate ho gya na?!", aisa likh dena.
27/11/2017, 08:23 - Abdul Bhaiya: Wondering whether she is correct or not?🤔🤔
27/11/2017, 08:24 - The Dark Knight: Lemme check. 😂.
27/11/2017, 08:24 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😂😂
27/11/2017, 08:26 - Abdul Bhaiya: Jaise you correct me that’s how she corrects me, as I agreed to it earlier in my beautiful universe.
27/11/2017, 08:26 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😢😢
27/11/2017, 08:27 - The Dark Knight: Mostly 'On' use hota h.
But like I said, few instances : "I saw these things pop up in my Facebook news feed", m 'in' suits aptly.
27/11/2017, 08:27 - The Dark Knight: But yeah, "On" zyadatar use hota h.
27/11/2017, 08:27 - The Dark Knight: She's correct. 👍🏻.
27/11/2017, 08:28 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😢😢😢
27/11/2017, 08:28 - Abdul Bhaiya: Mera pyara sa puppy 🐶 thi wo.

27/11/2017, 08:29 - The Dark Knight: Chhodo na, chutiye.
27/11/2017, 08:29 - Abdul Bhaiya: Daba deta tha usse pyar se.

27/11/2017, 09:10 - The Dark Knight: I-pill? 😜.
27/11/2017, 09:18 - Abdul Bhaiya: Given that to her 4 times.
27/11/2017, 09:19 - Abdul Bhaiya: Plus two months contraceptives.
27/11/2017, 09:47 - Abdul Bhaiya: Pata nhi bro feeling bit strange today.
27/11/2017, 09:48 - Abdul Bhaiya: Guess uper wala dekh raha h what we are planning and what we are doing.
27/11/2017, 09:50 - Abdul Bhaiya: I guess we should stop doing what we are doing and just move out that’s all.
27/11/2017, 09:50 - Abdul Bhaiya: Let’s not be an evil for a little bit at all .
27/11/2017, 09:53 - Abdul Bhaiya: Planning to let go.
Forgiving her for what she did.
Uper wala dekh lega.
I am gonna end this on Wednesday after you are through.
27/11/2017, 09:55 - Abdul Bhaiya: By saying let’s stop talking.
That’s how I am gonna end this. Decided!
Don’t wanna make my hand get dirty too.
27/11/2017, 09:57 - Abdul Bhaiya: Going offline jab whatsapp me text karega toh miss call maar diyo. 
Net on kr lunga.
I Am done with this game of being online.
27/11/2017, 09:58 - Abdul Bhaiya: I know it’s kinda running away but I feel it’s for good.
I have a change of heart.
27/11/2017, 09:58 - Abdul Bhaiya: Don’t know why?
27/11/2017, 10:32 - Abdul Bhaiya: I really had a big change of heart bro.
27/11/2017, 10:32 - Abdul Bhaiya: You come here I have few confessions to make.
Whatever is going to come on my way from now on I’ll take it up with a smile.
27/11/2017, 10:33 - Abdul Bhaiya: Planning to ask for sorry to Pooja too.
For really making her like this. I really think I am only responsible for this .
27/11/2017, 12:10 - The Dark Knight: Confessions? O.o.
27/11/2017, 12:10 - Abdul Bhaiya: Yeah.
27/11/2017, 12:11 - The Dark Knight: What confessions?
27/11/2017, 12:12 - Abdul Bhaiya: Better we have it face to face.
And relax itna bada b kuch nhi h.
So don’t get your expectations hyped up.
27/11/2017, 12:14 - The Dark Knight: (Mera case simple h. I trusted her with my conversation. But woh th sab kuch btati thi aapko. Mei chutiya ki tarah usko bolta tha ki uski meri conversation m aur extraterrestrial prani nhi h. I was loyal even till Friday, bro. You know that.).
27/11/2017, 12:14 - The Dark Knight: Kewl. :p.
27/11/2017, 12:15 - Abdul Bhaiya: Don’t know what is the reason for this message.
27/11/2017, 12:16 - Abdul Bhaiya: But chod aa kr baat kr lenge.
27/11/2017, 12:16 - The Dark Knight: The reason: I don't know what's going on in your mind. You might be having your reasons as she had hers. But I'm making my reasons crystal clear.
27/11/2017, 12:16 - Abdul Bhaiya: Prani?
27/11/2017, 12:17 - The Dark Knight: 👍🏻.
27/11/2017, 12:17 - The Dark Knight: Metaphor tha bhai. 😝.
27/11/2017, 12:18 - The Dark Knight: (Btw my reason even crystal clear: My trust with my conversation content was broken. And even more.).
27/11/2017, 12:19 - Abdul Bhaiya: Still I don’t know why you put me with her level.
But chod.
Pata nhi tu meri baato se kya samjha.
27/11/2017, 12:21 - The Dark Knight: Na na na.
Maine level shevel nhi rakha.

Aapne "confession" bola and said ki milke btata hu. Now I don't know kya bolne wale ho.

I just said ki sabke apne reasons hote h.
Maine apna poora poori bta diya. That's what I meant.
27/11/2017, 12:21 - Abdul Bhaiya: I really don’t understand why you are explaining all this to me.
I am not saying we are bad.
So relax.
I am just trying to say ki we have hold on to things which were not even having that much importance.
27/11/2017, 12:23 - Abdul Bhaiya: Oho bro just relax.
Aisa kuch b bada wala confession nhi h.
27/11/2017, 12:23 - The Dark Knight: Yeah, I got that.
But just like you were putting forward your point ki you feel you're responsible for her behavior and so you're sorry, th I thought even I should put forward my point as well.

No over thinking this time. Trust me.
27/11/2017, 12:24 - Abdul Bhaiya: Tu bus aa ja yaha apna sara kaam nipta kr.
And let me know ki kab ayega so I’ll make my plans accordingly.
27/11/2017, 12:24 - The Dark Knight: (You need to increase your typing speed. 😝. Time vs content ratio bht zyada h.).
27/11/2017, 12:25 - The Dark Knight: Cool. Cool.
I'll call you up.
Aaj ho paya th thik, else kal mil lenge.
27/11/2017, 12:26 - Abdul Bhaiya: In that case i am not able to understand your points so better you come here and then put forward your points too because messages me buri baat convey nhi ho pati.
27/11/2017, 12:26 - The Dark Knight: 😝👆🏻.
27/11/2017, 12:27 - The Dark Knight: Chalo will catch up with you later.
27/11/2017, 12:27 - Abdul Bhaiya: Sure bro.👍🏻
27/11/2017, 12:32 - Abdul Bhaiya: Not so sure what context you have driven from our conversation earlier.
But I feel jo b nikala h wo tohda sa messed up h.
27/11/2017, 12:33 - Abdul Bhaiya: I guess I was not able to make myself more clear or something.
27/11/2017, 12:50 - Abdul Bhaiya: *derived
27/11/2017, 12:50 - Abdul Bhaiya: Learning phase bro.
I guess with time I’ll eventually build up my speed.
27/11/2017, 14:41 - The Dark Knight: Of course! :p.
27/11/2017, 17:44 - Abdul Bhaiya: I’ll call you once I reach home plan of action from your end.

27/11/2017, 19:50 - Abdul Bhaiya: I really feel like whatever is going on in my life right now going to have a huge impact on my upcoming days.
27/11/2017, 19:51 - Abdul Bhaiya: Feels like I am living in a dream.
27/11/2017, 19:53 - Abdul Bhaiya: My soul getting lost day by day.
I really can’t understand what’s going on in my life.
I know I am gonna sound like Pooja but Really I feel my end is close very close.
27/11/2017, 19:56 - Abdul Bhaiya: I really don’t understand why I am getting a feeling like this but I feel ache log iss duniya me nhi reh sakte.
God I just wish ye Pooja wala chapter meri zindagi me kabhi nhi ata.
Feels lost.
27/11/2017, 19:58 - Abdul Bhaiya: Feeling needy and clingy right now.
27/11/2017, 19:58 - Abdul Bhaiya: Need support.
27/11/2017, 19:58 - Abdul Bhaiya: Don’t know what’s going on with me.
27/11/2017, 19:59 - Abdul Bhaiya: I really need you right now.(not in gay type way)😝😝😝
27/11/2017, 20:00 - Abdul Bhaiya: Just like a brother.
27/11/2017, 20:01 - Abdul Bhaiya: I guess my periods are talking.
27/11/2017, 20:03 - Abdul Bhaiya: Can’t believe that I can also go through this period phase.
I got a dick, a working one but I really wonder then why I am getting feelings like this.
27/11/2017, 20:12 - The Dark Knight: 😅😅😅😅
Chill. Snickers khao Snickers. Because jab aapko bhook lagti h tab aap ladki bn jate ho.
27/11/2017, 20:12 - The Dark Knight: 😂😂😂😂

27/11/2017, 20:18 - Abdul Bhaiya: Let me know once you are free.
27/11/2017, 20:22 - The Dark Knight: Call karo bhaiya.

27/11/2017, 22:49 - Abdul Bhaiya: Good night bro.
27/11/2017, 23:19 - The Dark Knight: Kal niklunga around 0800.
Breakfast karunga aapke saath.

Lunch ka no guarantee.
27/11/2017, 23:20 - Abdul Bhaiya: Pagal koi nhi yaar meri baato ko dil pr mat le araam se aa office jab ana chahe toh.
27/11/2017, 23:21 - Abdul Bhaiya: Mujhe laga wo Pooja me reply kiya tujhe.
27/11/2017, 23:21 - Abdul Bhaiya: Aur yaha dil or soo tir chal gaye the.
27/11/2017, 23:22 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😖😖😖
27/11/2017, 23:23 - Abdul Bhaiya: Yaar ye Pooja ko mai bhulaye nhi bul paa raha.
Charge pr laga rakha tha maine dusre room pr awaz sun kr bhagta bhagta aya ye soch kr ki uska kuch msg aya hoga.
27/11/2017, 23:24 - Abdul Bhaiya: Ye pyar kab khatum hoga yaar.
27/11/2017, 23:24 - The Dark Knight: Arre waise bhi PSN maha chutiya khana deta h.
And see, I guess I owe you this explanation.

Mereko pta tha ki aap Shrishti se baat karoge lunch time. Isliye morning ko bola mei ki at least PSN pehle jata hu then mahol k hisaab se we'll plan.
Secondly, bro, you know we've literally spent more than 24 hours talking to each other the entire weekend. So, I never thought ki lunch wala ka aapko aisa lag jaega.

Just explaining. In your words defending. 😝.

Topic change now.
27/11/2017, 23:24 - Abdul Bhaiya: Aj arijit ko ek line bol kr hi roo diya tha mai toh.
27/11/2017, 23:25 - The Dark Knight: Kaunsi?
27/11/2017, 23:25 - The Dark Knight: Arijit bhaiya ko naam bta diye?
27/11/2017, 23:25 - Abdul Bhaiya: Wahi- bahut pyar kiya tha ussey.
27/11/2017, 23:25 - Abdul Bhaiya: Unfortunately yes.
27/11/2017, 23:26 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😣😣
27/11/2017, 23:26 - The Dark Knight: Why unfortunately?! You didn't do anything wrong.
It's okay.
Arijit bhaiya achhe h.
27/11/2017, 23:26 - Abdul Bhaiya: But he have given his words ki he will keep it to himself.
27/11/2017, 23:27 - Abdul Bhaiya: But yaar I felt ki kahi wo judge na kare.
27/11/2017, 23:27 - Abdul Bhaiya: That’s why felt unfortunately.
27/11/2017, 23:27 - The Dark Knight: Group m join karo WhatsApp k with Amit sir and all.
They'll go crazy. Talk to people. Increase your social circle. (I did that during my phase. Works wonder.).
27/11/2017, 23:28 - Abdul Bhaiya: Ki emotions me beh kr mu khol diya mene
27/11/2017, 23:28 - Abdul Bhaiya: .
27/11/2017, 23:29 - The Dark Knight: Na. Bhaiya achhe h.
Bindass aadmi h. 👌🏻.
27/11/2017, 23:29 - Abdul Bhaiya: But felt ki shayed he’ll not judge.
27/11/2017, 23:30 - Abdul Bhaiya: Yes that’s true.
Aj jab baat ho rahi thi one on one then actually realise ki ache h that’s why I felt sharing it and opening up to him.
27/11/2017, 23:31 - Abdul Bhaiya: Now only 4 people knows about me and Pooja.
27/11/2017, 23:31 - Abdul Bhaiya: *4 people in this world
27/11/2017, 23:31 - The Dark Knight: Unko btaya ki mei bhi include ho gya?! 😝.
27/11/2017, 23:32 - Abdul Bhaiya: Nhi.
Fir toh meri izaat ka faluda ho jata.
27/11/2017, 23:32 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😝😝😝
27/11/2017, 23:33 - The Dark Knight: 😝😝😝😝😝😝.
27/11/2017, 23:34 - Abdul Bhaiya: But nhi actual me I thought why involve you and make him start judging Pooja ki dosto ko pakadti h.
27/11/2017, 23:35 - Abdul Bhaiya: Chal bhai tu really padh raha h ki nhi?
27/11/2017, 23:35 - The Dark Knight: Woh leg pull krte aur kuch nhi hota.
Basically humlog jab saath milte th inside joke pe hum teeno haste. 😂😂😂.
(Hum teeno bole th: Me, you and Arijit bhaiya.).
27/11/2017, 23:36 - The Dark Knight: Arre ha bhai.
Aapko kal k breakfast ka plan btane aya.
Jata hu ab.
27/11/2017, 23:36 - The Dark Knight: Bye.
27/11/2017, 23:36 - Abdul Bhaiya: No he have taken it seriously as he’s also in the same boat.
27/11/2017, 23:39 - Abdul Bhaiya: Chal bye.
Ager tu morning me padhta h toh breakfast wala plan cancel kr de bhai.
Abhi mera period khatum ho gaya so breakfast nhi b hoga toh chalega.
😝😝
27/11/2017, 23:40 - Abdul Bhaiya: Chal good night.
And ache se padh le.
28/11/2017, 06:38 - Abdul Bhaiya: Hi bro let me know if you’re coming for breakfast and also let me know the time.
28/11/2017, 06:45 - The Dark Knight: Around 8:15 I'll start from my PG.
9 baje tak aa jaunga.
28/11/2017, 06:45 - Abdul Bhaiya: Done ✅.
28/11/2017, 06:46 - The Dark Knight: Laura.
28/11/2017, 06:47 - The Dark Knight: I'm guessing either my mobile is fucked, or my roommate is turning off the alarm. -_-.
28/11/2017, 06:47 - Abdul Bhaiya: Rofl 🤣🤣🤣
28/11/2017, 06:48 - Abdul Bhaiya: You can test it by setting a new alarm when you are awake.
28/11/2017, 06:50 - The Dark Knight: Yeah yeah.
But this isn't good.
Mere saath pehle aisa hua h that roommate turned off the alarm clock isliye I considered that as a possibility as well.
28/11/2017, 07:47 - Abdul Bhaiya: Online??
28/11/2017, 07:47 - Abdul Bhaiya: Pooja ka koi msg?
28/11/2017, 07:47 - The Dark Knight: Bro, Pooja k alava bhi mere life log k to cater to. Chill.
28/11/2017, 07:48 - The Dark Knight: Mohita ki DP stalk kr rha tha from DI group.
Aaj bhi behenchod woh ayi sapne m.
28/11/2017, 07:48 - The Dark Knight: *h.
28/11/2017, 07:48 - Abdul Bhaiya: No bro I was just wanted to know ki uska msg aya?
28/11/2017, 07:49 - The Dark Knight: It might look like I'm obsessing about Mohita, but that's the fun part, because I'm not. I don't even think about her at least when I'm awake. But aaj firse. 😅.
28/11/2017, 07:49 - The Dark Knight: I need to talk to Mohita.
28/11/2017, 07:50 - The Dark Knight: Uska koi message wessage aaega th I'll let you know.
28/11/2017, 07:50 - Abdul Bhaiya: Yeah bro you gotta do that.
28/11/2017, 07:51 - The Dark Knight: Should I call her today and ask woh kab tak aaegi?
28/11/2017, 15:55 - Abdul Bhaiya: Aj jada hi ho Gaya yaar if I really think about it from the morning I am going to office at this time.
28/11/2017, 16:27 - The Dark Knight: Mujhe bhi wahi text aya.
"Hey
I'm in Bangalore".
28/11/2017, 18:02 - The Dark Knight: Net pack dalwa liya.
28/11/2017, 18:02 - Abdul Bhaiya: How’s this for a conversation-
28/11/2017, 18:03 - Abdul Bhaiya: #copied
She gave me her number.

And I called.

I got a match.

And I asked if we could speak on the phone.

“Sure.”

I called - and she declined it.

And replied with, “Sup?”

Call me old school, but I prefer voice over text.

The truth is I tried all the dating apps.

And they all failed me.

It’s a best-selfie contest.

With people advertising their Instagram and Snapchat.

I don’t care if you can make the best duck face.

Or own the cutest dog.

I’ve realized these apps objectify men and women.

I care about you as a person.

Especially, your values.

And selfies don’t translate to values.

I may not be as active as some of my peers on these dating apps.

But I’m sticking to my guns and building authentic relationships.

I may have fewer dates.

But at least don’t meet people off a few texts.

If you’re doing anything important with your life -

Your time is worth way more than that.

As an entrepreneur, I know better.

I don’t settle for what’s there.

I chase what could be.
28/11/2017, 18:04 - Abdul Bhaiya: Not the whole part.
What ever suits the current scenario.
28/11/2017, 18:05 - Abdul Bhaiya: *situation
28/11/2017, 18:05 - The Dark Knight: Ball suits the current scenario/situation. 😝.
28/11/2017, 18:06 - The Dark Knight: Pehla conversation m philosophical bullshit nhi chalta h.
28/11/2017, 18:06 - Abdul Bhaiya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
28/11/2017, 18:06 - Abdul Bhaiya: IMG-20171128-WA0001.jpg (file attached)
28/11/2017, 18:06 - Abdul Bhaiya: Okay.
👍🏻
28/11/2017, 18:07 - The Dark Knight: Don't advertise yourself. Be you.
Talk about her blog, that'll be a good start. Then one thing will lead to another if you're rooting for "authentic" conversation.
28/11/2017, 18:08 - The Dark Knight: <Media omitted>
28/11/2017, 18:08 - Abdul Bhaiya: But I am 💯 % sure ki me is authentic conversation ki maa behan kr dunga
28/11/2017, 18:08 - Abdul Bhaiya: .
28/11/2017, 18:08 - Abdul Bhaiya: *mai us authentic
28/11/2017, 18:13 - The Dark Knight: And refrain from using kiddish "100%". :p.
28/11/2017, 18:13 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😂😂😂
28/11/2017, 18:14 - The Dark Knight: Keep it blunt in terms of teenage style and use words to paint what you want to speak.
28/11/2017, 18:14 - Abdul Bhaiya: 👍🏻👍🏻
28/11/2017, 18:15 - The Dark Knight: Aapka "I'm in Bangalore" and mera wala m difference h.
28/11/2017, 18:15 - The Dark Knight: She used SMS language "m" instead of "am" with you.
Just an observation.
28/11/2017, 18:15 - Abdul Bhaiya: Nice observation bro.
28/11/2017, 18:16 - The Dark Knight: 😜👍🏻.
28/11/2017, 18:16 - Abdul Bhaiya: Yeah I got to know.
28/11/2017, 18:16 - Abdul Bhaiya: She have adopted that style only for you.
28/11/2017, 18:16 - Abdul Bhaiya: She is not using it for general public.
28/11/2017, 18:17 - The Dark Knight: I know. 😂.
Damn.
28/11/2017, 18:17 - Abdul Bhaiya: Plus that departure part also mismatch in case of timing.
28/11/2017, 18:18 - The Dark Knight: Nope. It's exact.
I use 24 hours format.
28/11/2017, 18:18 - Abdul Bhaiya: Chutiye because tu roo dega.
Not because she was impressed.
28/11/2017, 18:19 - The Dark Knight: She wants to impress.
28/11/2017, 18:19 - Abdul Bhaiya: Mai image ki baat kr raha tha bro.
28/11/2017, 18:20 - Abdul Bhaiya: Yeah if you want, you can put it in that way.
28/11/2017, 18:21 - The Dark Knight: Basically aapko pehle diya jata h.
Congrats, brother. ;).
28/11/2017, 18:21 - The Dark Knight: Mei soch rha hu Kajal ko guitar sikha du.
28/11/2017, 18:22 - Abdul Bhaiya: Chutiye again isme congratulate krne wali kya baat h .😝😝😝
28/11/2017, 18:22 - The Dark Knight: 😂😂😂.
28/11/2017, 18:22 - Abdul Bhaiya: Mohita.
28/11/2017, 18:25 - The Dark Knight: I don't want to make her feel like an option.
Isliye I planned much before Pooja's episode telecast that I'll ask Mohita to go out with me on date jab uska last day hoga TCS m.
28/11/2017, 18:26 - The Dark Knight: *a
28/11/2017, 18:27 - Abdul Bhaiya: She’s not an option bro.
She’s the real deal whereas Pooja was an option.
28/11/2017, 18:28 - Abdul Bhaiya: I guess you guys are meant to be.
As I told you earlier, I get a gut feeling that you guys are meant to be.
28/11/2017, 18:28 - Abdul Bhaiya: Not the IITian.
28/11/2017, 18:28 - The Dark Knight: Hmm. Yaar Mohita ne mujhe bhao bhi nhi diya tha. 😅. (The reason behind me deleting her number.).
I'm not saying ki I'll not try. But kutta ki tarah peeche nhi padna h.
28/11/2017, 18:28 - The Dark Knight: Lol. xD.
28/11/2017, 18:29 - The Dark Knight: I'll talk to her on Thursday then. After closing Pooja's chapter. 😅.
28/11/2017, 18:33 - Abdul Bhaiya: Because she is different.
Good things are harder to get remember.
You will not get an iit college approaching you.
You gotta make all efforts to get it.
Unlike other fishy colleges like fasana college which will approach you.
😝😝😝🤣🤣🤣
28/11/2017, 18:34 - The Dark Knight: Bas bro.
You couldn't do anything else to boost me up.
I'm texting her tonight.
28/11/2017, 18:35 - The Dark Knight: Pta h if Mohita agrees, I can bring my entire family to Chhatarpur, Indore for marriage proposal. I know I can.
28/11/2017, 18:35 - The Dark Knight: 😅.
28/11/2017, 18:36 - Abdul Bhaiya: I am still laughing about my statement “unlike other fishy college like fasana college”.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
28/11/2017, 18:36 - Abdul Bhaiya: *laughing at
28/11/2017, 18:36 - The Dark Knight: FIT: Fasana Institute of Technology.
28/11/2017, 18:37 - The Dark Knight: XD.
28/11/2017, 18:39 - The Dark Knight: (I'm thinking what should I text Mohita. 😅. Yes, even I need to think.).
28/11/2017, 18:39 - Abdul Bhaiya: Giving the context of her appearance, FAT abbreviation suits better then FIT.
28/11/2017, 18:39 - Abdul Bhaiya: Jab apne per ati h toh sab ki lagti h.😝😝😝
28/11/2017, 18:40 - The Dark Knight: FIT is ironical, bro. 😂.
But apne (as of now) kaunsa fit h. 😝.
28/11/2017, 18:40 - The Dark Knight: Yes. 😂😂😂.
28/11/2017, 18:40 - Abdul Bhaiya: Alhha maaf kare.
28/11/2017, 18:40 - The Dark Knight: Karo text Sristi ko. 👍🏻.
28/11/2017, 18:41 - Abdul Bhaiya: Apne??
28/11/2017, 18:41 - Abdul Bhaiya: Kya ?
28/11/2017, 18:41 - The Dark Knight: (I guess I know what I'll be texting. :). ).
28/11/2017, 18:42 - Abdul Bhaiya: First I gotta change my dp.
28/11/2017, 18:42 - Abdul Bhaiya: To whom?
Bhai mera b tujhe hi sambhal na hoga yaad rakh.
28/11/2017, 18:43 - The Dark Knight: Hi! 
I was just going through my contact list when I saw your profile pic. It couldn't get any truer. Thought of saying a "Hi" to you.
28/11/2017, 18:43 - The Dark Knight: This is what I'll be texting. ^.
28/11/2017, 18:43 - Abdul Bhaiya: To?
28/11/2017, 18:44 - The Dark Knight: Yeah! Keep that blind cricket wala.
28/11/2017, 18:44 - The Dark Knight: Mohita. Of course!
28/11/2017, 18:44 - Abdul Bhaiya: In case of sristi her profile pic is hidden.
28/11/2017, 18:44 - The Dark Knight: She didn't save your contact. 😝.
28/11/2017, 18:45 - Abdul Bhaiya: Not my whatsapp number.
28/11/2017, 18:45 - The Dark Knight: Oh okay. Right. Makes sense.
28/11/2017, 18:45 - Abdul Bhaiya: I guess jio wala kiya hoga.
28/11/2017, 18:45 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😅😅😅
28/11/2017, 18:45 - The Dark Knight: Text her about the blog.
28/11/2017, 18:46 - Abdul Bhaiya: Hope so!
😅😅😅
28/11/2017, 18:47 - The Dark Knight: Tell her that you want to have a look at her blog, but you want to start with the work which she thinks is her best. And ask her to forward you the link.
28/11/2017, 18:47 - Abdul Bhaiya: You gotta do that.
Give me the exact message bro.
Literally I’ll be a parasite in this case.
You gotta help me out here bro.
Tujhe dua ye milegi mujh se.
😝😝😝😝
28/11/2017, 18:48 - Abdul Bhaiya: ^
28/11/2017, 18:49 - Abdul Bhaiya: From gunde wali to something better(decent).
28/11/2017, 18:49 - The Dark Knight: If she instead asks you to search for, say, umm, "ABC" <- title of the page (not the blog), then ask her to send the link instead.
28/11/2017, 18:49 - The Dark Knight: Yep.
28/11/2017, 18:50 - The Dark Knight: Chalo, I'll talk to you later.
28/11/2017, 18:50 - Abdul Bhaiya: Gher pahuch gaya?
28/11/2017, 18:50 - The Dark Knight: Ha.
PG pohocha. Ghar nhi. :p.
28/11/2017, 18:51 - Abdul Bhaiya: Convey ho gaya na?
28/11/2017, 18:51 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😝😝😝
28/11/2017, 18:51 - The Dark Knight: <Media omitted>
28/11/2017, 18:52 - The Dark Knight: <Media omitted>
28/11/2017, 18:54 - Abdul Bhaiya: Hmm.
Have tried to convince her with all you got?
I mean jis ko hum actual me chate h na toh us k comfort ko consider kr k baat krte h.
That’s why I asked.
28/11/2017, 18:55 - Abdul Bhaiya: *have you
28/11/2017, 18:56 - Abdul Bhaiya: So we just put 50% aur us k baad we retract.
28/11/2017, 18:56 - Abdul Bhaiya: Just not to make situation uncomfortable.
28/11/2017, 18:57 - The Dark Knight: Nope. I was like "Okay. Cool.". :p.
Uska mera verbal fight bhi hua tha. She thought ki just because I sit quiet, that I find it "cool". Debate hua th poora team k samne. Somnath sir was like: "Yes, fight. I love to see fights.".
28/11/2017, 18:57 - Abdul Bhaiya: But thoda aur push kr diya hota toh shayed baat ban jati.
28/11/2017, 18:57 - The Dark Knight: Hmm.
28/11/2017, 18:57 - Abdul Bhaiya: I know.
You have told me.
28/11/2017, 18:58 - The Dark Knight: I'll text her, man.
I'll give it a final try.
I'll talk and ask her to meet. And I'll tell her what I feel, face to face.
28/11/2017, 18:58 - Abdul Bhaiya: Impact of FIT college.
28/11/2017, 18:59 - The Dark Knight: No, man.
Stop comparing already. 😝.
That word existed much before she turned up in our life. The word seems polluted, but every storm has its end too.
28/11/2017, 18:59 - Abdul Bhaiya: Rather I would recommend ki you just tell her bahut dino se mile nhi h so I thought time nikal kr mil lete h kal.
28/11/2017, 19:01 - The Dark Knight: Arre that's what I'll tell her. But when I meet her, I'll confess ki why I called her.
28/11/2017, 19:01 - The Dark Knight: I'll simply say (if the conversation goes good) : "Let's meet tomorrow for lunch at Inorbit mall.".
28/11/2017, 19:02 - Abdul Bhaiya: But bro as conversation orgasmer  you should never use such a stupid sentence.
28/11/2017, 19:03 - Abdul Bhaiya: Don’t want to demoralise but I really doubt it bro.
28/11/2017, 19:04 - The Dark Knight: It depends on usage frequency. :p.
"Hmm" is a socially acceptable word with lot of potential and versatility. 😂.
28/11/2017, 19:04 - The Dark Knight: Umm, why? O.o.
Explain, maybe?
28/11/2017, 19:05 - Abdul Bhaiya: Jaisi wo h, I just think she’ll decline.
28/11/2017, 19:06 - The Dark Knight: Bro, if I ask "Hey! Kaafi din ho gya h, let's meet.", chances are she'll even include Azim. Because a similar thing has happened before.
28/11/2017, 19:06 - Abdul Bhaiya: I guess she will not feel comfortable to meet you in Inorbit.
That’s what I think.
It can be my false assumption.
28/11/2017, 19:07 - Abdul Bhaiya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
28/11/2017, 19:08 - The Dark Knight: "Let's meet." is so ambiguous by nature. The reason is there's no plan you can see there. Nothing definite. 😅.
28/11/2017, 19:08 - The Dark Knight: Either that or I simply speak my heart out by asking her to meet me tomorrow and that there's something I need to tell her.
28/11/2017, 19:09 - Abdul Bhaiya: In that case, add few things which are personal to you and her.
Some common ground like - higher education or leaving Tcs or something about future plans which you want to discuss with her personally face to face.
28/11/2017, 19:09 - The Dark Knight: Balls. 😂.
28/11/2017, 19:10 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😂😂😂
28/11/2017, 19:10 - The Dark Knight: You don't say in text that you want to speak about those aforementioned common topics face to face. 😝.
28/11/2017, 19:11 - The Dark Knight: I'll go with lunch depending on how my conversation goes. Else I can't do it, bro. My way of talking can swing away different kind of girls, but not the one I need. ( I guess. ).
28/11/2017, 19:11 - Abdul Bhaiya: But at least you can just give a clue.
Well better ask your guru bro.
28/11/2017, 19:12 - Abdul Bhaiya: True!
28/11/2017, 19:12 - The Dark Knight: I know he'd say the same thing I'm telling you right now. 😜.
28/11/2017, 19:13 - Abdul Bhaiya: Ho sakta h wo kuch our of blue suggest kr de.
28/11/2017, 19:13 - The Dark Knight: I know how his and my brain works during texting (at least). He'll be proud of my texting skills. (Btw he is. 😜).
28/11/2017, 19:13 - Abdul Bhaiya: Oh!
But mere gut feeling saying ki wo shayed roo degi.
28/11/2017, 19:15 - The Dark Knight: Cool. Let her. Then probably I'll be the first guy who directly asked her out for lunch. (Who knows. 😅).
28/11/2017, 19:15 - Abdul Bhaiya: Hope in the in the near future I’ll join the club.
28/11/2017, 19:15 - Abdul Bhaiya: *(only one time) in the
😝😝😝😝
28/11/2017, 19:16 - The Dark Knight: With full stops usage soaring sky high, I see you rocketing into the texting-bros-fraternity. xD.
28/11/2017, 19:16 - Abdul Bhaiya: Ho sakta h.
But I guess you should not stop there.
28/11/2017, 19:18 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😅😅😅
28/11/2017, 19:19 - The Dark Knight: Again, depends on how the conversation goes.
Because the last time I conversed with her over text, she seemed a bit disinterested. And this was long back when we used to be in the same ODC.
Imagine what'll happen now. I'm gonna text her without any hopes. Isliye I guess I'll have guts enough to ask her out for lunch. 😅.
28/11/2017, 19:19 - Abdul Bhaiya: I wonder about my comma usage.🤔🤔
28/11/2017, 19:20 - The Dark Knight: Sab seekh jaoge. 😝.
28/11/2017, 19:20 - Abdul Bhaiya: Yeah sure at least it’s worth the shot.
28/11/2017, 19:20 - The Dark Knight: Worth the shot, indeed.
28/11/2017, 19:21 - Abdul Bhaiya: But how am I so far?
I haven’t seen you using any commas in any of your sentences.
28/11/2017, 19:21 - The Dark Knight: You need to observe.
28/11/2017, 19:22 - Abdul Bhaiya: 1st time.🤣🤣
28/11/2017, 19:22 - The Dark Knight: Again, observe. (Here too.).
28/11/2017, 19:22 - The Dark Knight: Nope. You missed a lot in that case.
28/11/2017, 19:22 - Abdul Bhaiya: Oh yeah!
I missed it.
28/11/2017, 19:22 - Abdul Bhaiya: Let me check.
28/11/2017, 19:23 - Abdul Bhaiya: Why did you use “,” before bro?
28/11/2017, 19:24 - The Dark Knight: (I'm going in for the text. Wish me luck. :p.).
28/11/2017, 19:24 - Abdul Bhaiya: 👍🏻👍🏻
28/11/2017, 19:24 - Abdul Bhaiya: Uper wala tumhari jodi jarur banayega.
28/11/2017, 19:25 - The Dark Knight: It really depends on where and how you want to give a pause. I know I've a thing for theatricality, so I go for it at places where other people might feel like "Why?! 🤔".
28/11/2017, 19:25 - Abdul Bhaiya: Remember just don’t retreat.
28/11/2017, 19:25 - The Dark Knight: Lol. 😂.
28/11/2017, 19:26 - Abdul Bhaiya: Or probably the usage is not correct.😝😝😂😂🤣🤣
28/11/2017, 19:27 - The Dark Knight: Read "theatricality". Dramatized way se bolta hu. :p.
28/11/2017, 19:27 - Abdul Bhaiya: Bro I got to know what you meant.
28/11/2017, 19:28 - The Dark Knight: I just wondered ki uski ye DP kabse lagi h. Because if I'm not wrong uski DP ye wali BOHOT pehle bhi thi. 😝. (I've probably forgotten, because I'm talking about some 5-6 months now.).
28/11/2017, 19:29 - The Dark Knight: I've to go for some other way now. Shit. :(.
28/11/2017, 19:29 - Abdul Bhaiya: From where did you get her number?
28/11/2017, 19:29 - The Dark Knight: DI group.
28/11/2017, 19:29 - Abdul Bhaiya: 🤣
28/11/2017, 19:29 - The Dark Knight: *got.
28/11/2017, 19:30 - The Dark Knight: Na na.
28/11/2017, 19:30 - The Dark Knight: Duck.
28/11/2017, 19:30 - The Dark Knight: *Fuck.
28/11/2017, 19:30 - The Dark Knight: Sorry.
28/11/2017, 19:30 - The Dark Knight: "get" sahi tha.
28/11/2017, 19:30 - The Dark Knight: I'm sorry.
28/11/2017, 19:30 - Abdul Bhaiya: Did and got?
28/11/2017, 19:30 - Abdul Bhaiya: Fuck!!!
28/11/2017, 19:31 - The Dark Knight: Ye office m baaki log ki English usage did and got wali hoti h and I'm habituated to rectify this. So I simply used the inverse. Sorry, bro. 😅.
28/11/2017, 19:32 - Abdul Bhaiya: Bro ye past tense and did wali class meri bahut li h logo ne.
28/11/2017, 19:32 - The Dark Knight: 😝😝😝.
28/11/2017, 19:33 - Abdul Bhaiya: Aur tune mujhe usi me galat correct kiya chutiya!
28/11/2017, 19:33 - The Dark Knight: Arre sochne do mujhe ki kya likhu. :p.
28/11/2017, 19:33 - Abdul Bhaiya: *bahut hi logo ne li h
28/11/2017, 19:34 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😅👍🏻
28/11/2017, 19:34 - The Dark Knight: Darr lag rha h. 😂.
28/11/2017, 19:34 - Abdul Bhaiya: <Media omitted>
28/11/2017, 19:34 - The Dark Knight: Because kuch chutiya types nhi likhna.
28/11/2017, 19:35 - Abdul Bhaiya: Bro my voice sounds like shit!
😖😖😖
28/11/2017, 19:36 - The Dark Knight: Arre chutiye normal bulane k liye I need to have some level of conversation today. And that in turn requires me to start on an interesting "ice breaking" note. Fuck, man. These women. They make us men work soooooo much. 😝.
28/11/2017, 19:36 - The Dark Knight: It's psychological. Everyone hates their own voice. (Google krlena. Aisa sach m h.).
28/11/2017, 19:37 - Abdul Bhaiya: Pagal just keep it simple.
28/11/2017, 19:37 - Abdul Bhaiya: I know.
But tab bhi.😣😣
28/11/2017, 19:38 - Abdul Bhaiya: Jita soche ga utna complicate krega.
28/11/2017, 19:45 - The Dark Knight: I stumbled on your profile while browsing through my contact list, when it struck me that you've probably completed your two years in TCS. (I guess it was around this time, right? ).

So thought of saying a "Hi". So, hi. :p.
28/11/2017, 19:45 - The Dark Knight: Bhej diya.
28/11/2017, 19:45 - The Dark Knight: 🤘🏻😎.
28/11/2017, 19:47 - Abdul Bhaiya: All the best bro!
28/11/2017, 19:47 - Abdul Bhaiya: 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
28/11/2017, 19:48 - The Dark Knight: Kaisa lga? 😜.
28/11/2017, 19:48 - The Dark Knight: Thank you. Thank you. 😅.
28/11/2017, 19:48 - Abdul Bhaiya: Don’t ask. Mai sach bol duga.😝😝😝
28/11/2017, 19:48 - The Dark Knight: Chutiye ho. Isme kharab kya tha? :(.
28/11/2017, 19:49 - Abdul Bhaiya: 🤣🤣🤣
28/11/2017, 19:49 - The Dark Knight: 😒
28/11/2017, 19:49 - The Dark Knight: Popat ho gya then I presume. -_-.
28/11/2017, 19:49 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😂😂😂
28/11/2017, 19:50 - Abdul Bhaiya: From my point of view bro.
28/11/2017, 19:50 - The Dark Knight: Usko simply bol diya ki I WANNA TALK TO YOU.
28/11/2017, 19:50 - The Dark Knight: I can still delete the message I guess.
28/11/2017, 19:50 - Abdul Bhaiya: Because I think she is not like other girls. I think she likes simplicity.
28/11/2017, 19:51 - The Dark Knight: This was simple AF.
28/11/2017, 19:51 - The Dark Knight: Further down "simple" m sirf : 'Hi' hi tha.
28/11/2017, 19:52 - Abdul Bhaiya: Again this is my point of view(jiska haal fil haal me popat ho chuka h😔😔😭)
28/11/2017, 19:53 - Abdul Bhaiya: By fasana of course!
28/11/2017, 19:53 - The Dark Knight: Okay okay.
Let's prove you wrong.
That was a sweet gesture from my end with a hint that I wanna talk to her.
Anyway, let's see.
28/11/2017, 19:53 - The Dark Knight: I'll go now.
28/11/2017, 19:54 - The Dark Knight: I'll eat and sit for study.
28/11/2017, 19:54 - Abdul Bhaiya: What about that message?
28/11/2017, 19:54 - Abdul Bhaiya: Bheja ki nhi?
28/11/2017, 19:54 - The Dark Knight: Bhejne k baad hi I forwarded you. :p.
28/11/2017, 19:55 - Abdul Bhaiya: Rofl 🤣
28/11/2017, 19:55 - The Dark Knight: 😒
28/11/2017, 19:55 - Abdul Bhaiya: Chal ab uper wale k bharose chod de.
28/11/2017, 19:55 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😂🤣😝😝😝
28/11/2017, 19:55 - The Dark Knight: Kutte. 😂😂😂😂.
28/11/2017, 19:56 - The Dark Knight: Chalo. Bye.
28/11/2017, 19:56 - Abdul Bhaiya: Bye 👋🏻.
28/11/2017, 20:45 - Abdul Bhaiya: Getting a call from Pooja.
28/11/2017, 21:23 - Abdul Bhaiya: IMG-20171128-WA0006.jpg (file attached)
28/11/2017, 23:08 - The Dark Knight: Katt gya mera Mohita wala. 😂.
28/11/2017, 23:09 - The Dark Knight: Aisa bura wala fail ki dikha bhi nhi sakta mei chat.
28/11/2017, 23:10 - The Dark Knight: It's like cricket gear pehenke batsman utra tha field m. 3 balls m out.
28/11/2017, 23:18 - The Dark Knight: She followed binary texting style.
Started with 4 lines.
Then 2.
At last 1.
So my chat lasted for ceil(log(n))+1.
(Where 'n' is the initial text lines from her end.).
28/11/2017, 23:19 - The Dark Knight: Like joota maarke nikala usne, bro.
Aap dekhoge th poori life mujhpe hasoge.
Now I doubt if I should help you with Sristi. I'm not good at wooing girls. :(.
28/11/2017, 23:21 - Abdul Bhaiya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
28/11/2017, 23:21 - Abdul Bhaiya: Relax
28/11/2017, 23:21 - The Dark Knight: 😝😝😝😝
28/11/2017, 23:21 - The Dark Knight: No bro, I can't.
28/11/2017, 23:21 - Abdul Bhaiya: Pooja on I am going offline.
28/11/2017, 23:22 - The Dark Knight: I admit I'm not good at cracking jokes.
But the way received her reply. It was an emasculating experience. 😝.
28/11/2017, 23:22 - The Dark Knight: *I.
28/11/2017, 23:23 - The Dark Knight: She's not online.
28/11/2017, 23:23 - Abdul Bhaiya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
28/11/2017, 23:24 - Abdul Bhaiya: You gotta share the screen shot.
28/11/2017, 23:24 - The Dark Knight: Laura mera share karunga.
28/11/2017, 23:24 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😶😶😶
28/11/2017, 23:24 - The Dark Knight: Bhaiya!
28/11/2017, 23:24 - Abdul Bhaiya: You have to bro.
Nhi hassu ga I promise.
28/11/2017, 23:25 - The Dark Knight: Aap uske reply pe th hasoge hi.
Mere reply m th aapka pet fatt jaega. You'll feel exactly the same how I felt today PSN m.
(That's the brighter side. 😝).
28/11/2017, 23:26 - Abdul Bhaiya: Koi na bhai just share kr.
28/11/2017, 23:26 - The Dark Knight: <Media omitted>
28/11/2017, 23:27 - The Dark Knight: <Media omitted>
28/11/2017, 23:28 - The Dark Knight: 😔😔😔😔
28/11/2017, 23:28 - Abdul Bhaiya: I fucking loved your joke bro.
28/11/2017, 23:29 - Abdul Bhaiya: Mai usi joke pr sex kr leta.
28/11/2017, 23:29 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😝😝😝
28/11/2017, 23:29 - The Dark Knight: Sarcasm? O.o. o.O.
28/11/2017, 23:30 - Abdul Bhaiya: No.
Really bro that was a good one.
Sristi wala toh tu hi handle👋🏻 karega.
28/11/2017, 23:31 - The Dark Knight: You saw Mohita's reply. 😒.
28/11/2017, 23:32 - The Dark Knight: And I've a rule. I just can't reply to a blunt "haha","lol",other nonsense verbal laughter. 😔.
She did that.
28/11/2017, 23:32 - The Dark Knight: Conclusion: SHE'S SIMPLY NOT INTERESTED.
28/11/2017, 23:32 - Abdul Bhaiya: If I have to understand why she replied in that way then I guess it’s because of your brackets part.
28/11/2017, 23:32 - The Dark Knight: Else she's a good conversationalist.
28/11/2017, 23:33 - Abdul Bhaiya: Chutiya.
28/11/2017, 23:33 - Abdul Bhaiya: Sarcasm?
28/11/2017, 23:34 - The Dark Knight: Brackets define me.
A coder is defined by proper semantically matching brackets.
Brackets convey my side emotions. It's like converception (inception of conversation.). Fuck, man. 😝. I'm soooo weird.
28/11/2017, 23:34 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😒😒😒😒
28/11/2017, 23:34 - Abdul Bhaiya: Chutiya!
28/11/2017, 23:36 - Abdul Bhaiya: Jo shayed wo bolne ka plan kr rahi hogi wo tu me hi bol kr usse paka diya aur kaha I know.
28/11/2017, 23:36 - The Dark Knight: No. She actually is.
It's just that she's disinterested.
There are reasons for her to feel so.

I was never participating in their group. I used to refuse going on tea breaks with them.

I showed attitude to Sueli Dey. Their entire group loves her.

Etc. Etc. Etc.

PS. She really thinks I've attitude problem. 😝.
28/11/2017, 23:36 - Abdul Bhaiya: *tu ne
28/11/2017, 23:38 - Abdul Bhaiya: Then why did you mention else?🤔🤔🤔
Accepted - sueli dey.
Rest is garbage!
28/11/2017, 23:39 - The Dark Knight: Laura mera.
See bro, ek initial level of attraction bhi honi chaiye. I admit log paida krte h "attraction" but I've no clue aur kaise karu.
Usne mujhe gym, guitar, singing, flirting, alpha male, etc sab dekha h. Isse zyada laura mujhe bhi nhi pta aur kya karu to attract her and make her know ki mei family type banda hu. 😝.
28/11/2017, 23:39 - Abdul Bhaiya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
28/11/2017, 23:40 - The Dark Knight: The else part was a continuation to this. 😅.
28/11/2017, 23:40 - Abdul Bhaiya: It’s all because of your this shitty thinking.
28/11/2017, 23:42 - The Dark Knight: Bro! Meri hardly chat hui usse. Isbar usne reham khake reply th kiya. Pichle baar th aisi feeling ayi jaise raste pe mei kuch bechne nikla hu and koi kharid nhi rha. 😂.
28/11/2017, 23:42 - Abdul Bhaiya: You just over think all this shit.
I feel like I have to get down and under into this mess.
28/11/2017, 23:43 - The Dark Knight: Sristi ki profile pic dikhao. Mera chhodo.
Trust me bro, I know when things will workout, or not (or beech m(Fuck! Yaha bhi overthink maar diya. 😝)).
28/11/2017, 23:44 - Abdul Bhaiya: Your thinking and attitude matters a lot.
This shit you are trying to feed your self is down right stupid.
28/11/2017, 23:44 - The Dark Knight: Don't.
Mereko kisika pity wala attention nhi chaiye. Ego hurt ho jaegi. 😝.
So let it be.
28/11/2017, 23:44 - The Dark Knight: Woh sab chhodo! 
Sristi ki profile pic dikhao. And btw Pooja ne kya bola?
28/11/2017, 23:45 - Abdul Bhaiya: It’s not pity bro.
It’s me utilising my wing man skills.😝😝😝
28/11/2017, 23:46 - The Dark Knight: Bwahahaha. 😂😂😂.
28/11/2017, 23:46 - Abdul Bhaiya: Pooja se baat hi nhi hui.
28/11/2017, 23:46 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😒😒😒
28/11/2017, 23:46 - The Dark Knight: <Media omitted>
28/11/2017, 23:46 - Abdul Bhaiya: IMG-20171128-WA0010.jpg (file attached)
28/11/2017, 23:47 - The Dark Knight: Arre you told na she called! Isliye I thought you picked it up, because you were saying ki next time if she calls, you'll.
28/11/2017, 23:48 - The Dark Knight: Oh fuck! Baar baar bhool ja rha hu.

Likh do, nice DP. 👌🏻😜.
28/11/2017, 23:48 - Abdul Bhaiya: Don’t remember me saying that.
But I didn’t pick up the call.
28/11/2017, 23:48 - The Dark Knight: Kaustav ko dekhe? 
Unme se 2 at least raand zaroor h.
28/11/2017, 23:49 - Abdul Bhaiya: 🤣🤣🤣
Good suggestion bro without introducing myself bus bakchodi start kr du.
28/11/2017, 23:50 - The Dark Knight: 😂😂😂😂😂😂.
Teasing note pe start karoge then isse achha ice break nhi ho sakta.
28/11/2017, 23:51 - Abdul Bhaiya: “Kautsv obsession”
28/11/2017, 23:51 - The Dark Knight: <Media omitted>
28/11/2017, 23:52 - The Dark Knight: Arre he changed his DP, so I opened it up. Realized ki bangaliyon ki fauj taiyar khadi rakhi h.
28/11/2017, 23:53 - Abdul Bhaiya: Plus “nice dp”
How unique !!
Aisa toh duniya me pheli baar usey ye kisi ne bola hoga.
28/11/2017, 23:55 - The Dark Knight: Sarcasm? O.o. o.O.
(Clarifying. :p.).
Because "nice DP" th hazaro ne bola hoga. But ye bolke usko realize krvana ki "meri maa, ye number save kr mera." pehli baar hoga.
28/11/2017, 23:55 - Abdul Bhaiya: Man your dad looks handsome.
Now I come to know from where you got your looks.
28/11/2017, 23:56 - The Dark Knight: Thanks, man. 😅.
28/11/2017, 23:56 - The Dark Knight: I told you na that you resemble uncle A LOT?!
28/11/2017, 23:57 - The Dark Knight: Mei Kajal ko text kr rha hu guitar session krvane.
28/11/2017, 23:57 - Abdul Bhaiya: Oh now I got it.
I wonder usko b samjh me ayega ya wo b like kya chutiya h ye toh sab chutiya kat te h.
28/11/2017, 23:58 - The Dark Knight: Bol dunga hotel book krle, wahi sikha dunga jo bhi bolegi. 😂.
28/11/2017, 23:58 - Abdul Bhaiya: Who me?
With your uncle?
You never told me this.
28/11/2017, 23:59 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😒😒😒
Bakchodi.
28/11/2017, 23:59 - The Dark Knight: Take a screenshot of her DP and then send it to her saying "Nice DP!".
29/11/2017, 00:00 - The Dark Knight: 😝😝😝
Yaar Mohita se nhi hone wala mera kuch. Mujhe 100% guarantee h ki nhi hoga. Isliye socha ki ab th Guitar teacher hi bn jata hu. 😜.
29/11/2017, 00:00 - The Dark Knight: You can try sending it to her now.
29/11/2017, 00:01 - Abdul Bhaiya: And then she’ll be like kitna happening banda h.
Kitni lambi contact list h is ki.
He must be very famous!
29/11/2017, 00:01 - The Dark Knight: Chutiye! 
You're supposed to click on her DP, take a screenshot and then send.
29/11/2017, 00:02 - Abdul Bhaiya: Tujh se toh wo b Nhi ho payega.
Rehne de tu. 😒😒😒
29/11/2017, 00:03 - Abdul Bhaiya: Then she’ll be like chutiye tu kon h jo mai tera no save karu?
29/11/2017, 00:03 - The Dark Knight: I know. 😝😝😝.
But bolne m kya jata h?!
See, I can go till 3rd base, not beyond that. And some guitar lessons as icing on the ass.
29/11/2017, 00:03 - The Dark Knight: *cake. 😜
29/11/2017, 00:03 - The Dark Knight: Your profile pic will be visible to her. 😒.
29/11/2017, 00:04 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😂
29/11/2017, 00:04 - Abdul Bhaiya: No!
29/11/2017, 00:04 - The Dark Knight: Yes, chutiye! 
It'll be visible.
29/11/2017, 00:05 - Abdul Bhaiya: Even if I do that then she’ll be like chutiye unknown number se whatsapp use kr k mujh pr taunt maar raha h ki pic save nhi ki.
29/11/2017, 00:06 - Abdul Bhaiya: *number save nhi kiya
29/11/2017, 00:07 - Abdul Bhaiya: Oh yes.😅😅
29/11/2017, 00:08 - The Dark Knight: Possible.

So do this.

"Nice DP!
Two things: Either the girl is faceless (GoT reference) or it's time that the girl saves the guy's number (again, GoT reference). Valar Morghulis.

I hope the girl watches GoT, does she? :p.".
29/11/2017, 00:08 - Abdul Bhaiya: IMG-20171129-WA0000.jpg (file attached)
29/11/2017, 00:09 - The Dark Knight: I feel this will be a nice playful way to break the ice.
29/11/2017, 00:09 - Abdul Bhaiya: Not sure.
But this one is nice one gonna give it a shot.
29/11/2017, 00:09 - The Dark Knight: Plus it opens up door to pursue conversation about t.v. shows she watches.
29/11/2017, 00:10 - Abdul Bhaiya: And from there you gotta carry on as I’ll fuck that door 🚪.
29/11/2017, 00:10 - The Dark Knight: I did this with Mohita. :(.
(Periods.).
29/11/2017, 00:11 - Abdul Bhaiya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
29/11/2017, 00:11 - The Dark Knight: Lol. 😂.
I'd be naughty, bro. I'm good at that.
Even when she's ready for a sex chat, I'll do it for you. Just watch and learn. 😜.
29/11/2017, 00:12 - Abdul Bhaiya: Koi nhi bro Teri story toh start hi kaha hui h jo tu usko khatum krne per tula h.
29/11/2017, 00:12 - The Dark Knight: Turned out she doesn't watch any. Plus she didn't ask me back if I watch.
29/11/2017, 00:13 - Abdul Bhaiya: I am okay with that too as I’ll be doing the real deal.😝😝😝
29/11/2017, 00:14 - Abdul Bhaiya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ganda wala kata tera toh.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
29/11/2017, 00:14 - The Dark Knight: Bhaiya! This is not the first time. Isse pehle bhi it's me who's asking her questions (not like KBC: "Agla prashna aapke WhatsApp screen m ye rha with options".), but proper questions, open ended questions. Woh kaat deti thi mera.
29/11/2017, 00:15 - The Dark Knight: I know right. 😔.
29/11/2017, 00:15 - Abdul Bhaiya: Based on that I really doubt that she is good conversationalist.😒😒
29/11/2017, 00:16 - The Dark Knight: Or perhaps she's disinterested. I'll bet on that, bro.
29/11/2017, 00:16 - The Dark Knight: Anyway, aap Sristi ko woh bhejna kal.
29/11/2017, 00:17 - The Dark Knight: Exactly copy paste maar do.
29/11/2017, 00:17 - Abdul Bhaiya: Probably.
As I think ki wo personal conversation ko jada prefer karti hogi.
29/11/2017, 00:18 - Abdul Bhaiya: Yes.
I’ll do that when you are free.
29/11/2017, 00:18 - The Dark Knight: Man, I even complimented her on her dress in front of my team's architect. :/.
29/11/2017, 00:19 - The Dark Knight: Lol. 😂.
29/11/2017, 00:20 - Abdul Bhaiya: Because I really don’t want to fuck the door.
Hole chota hoga.(bad pj as well :p)
29/11/2017, 00:21 - The Dark Knight: Evergreen virgin door h, bro. :p.
29/11/2017, 00:21 - The Dark Knight: Fasana Fasana.
29/11/2017, 00:21 - The Dark Knight: Fasana Fasana.
29/11/2017, 00:21 - The Dark Knight: Fasana Fasana.
29/11/2017, 00:22 - The Dark Knight: Mei hu Pooja Kasana.
29/11/2017, 00:22 - Abdul Bhaiya: So what exactly you are expecting out of her?
Ki wo tere team’s architect k samne hi tujh pr kud jaye?
29/11/2017, 00:22 - The Dark Knight: Damn. This song. :'). Oscar de bhi do koi!
29/11/2017, 00:22 - Abdul Bhaiya: 🤔🤔🤔
29/11/2017, 00:23 - Abdul Bhaiya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
29/11/2017, 00:23 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂
29/11/2017, 00:24 - Abdul Bhaiya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂
29/11/2017, 00:25 - The Dark Knight: I just said ki maine try kiya h uspe. Ye mera usko 4th text tha (in terms of initiation.). Har waqt mera kata hi h. :p.
Usko face to face bola let's hangout together and she was like "Yeah! Azim is also there.".
I'm like "I gotta go. 🙂👍🏻.".
29/11/2017, 00:25 - The Dark Knight: 😜😜😜😜
29/11/2017, 00:26 - The Dark Knight: Chalo bro chhodo. Let's sleep.
Big day tomorrow. 😝.
29/11/2017, 00:26 - Abdul Bhaiya: Okay I’ll take care of azim from now onwards.

Anyway, good night, bro.
29/11/2017, 00:28 - Abdul Bhaiya: Don’t lose hope bro.
You are not doing justice with the iit.

29/11/2017, 00:29 - Abdul Bhaiya: Good night 👋🏻😴😴😴
29/11/2017, 00:29 - The Dark Knight: Neither going for IIT or FIT.
I'm going for MILFIT.
29/11/2017, 00:29 - The Dark Knight: 😂
29/11/2017, 00:30 - Abdul Bhaiya: Ya I know that’s another branch of FIT.
29/11/2017, 00:30 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😂😂😂
29/11/2017, 00:31 - Abdul Bhaiya: In case of sristi I have extra set of emojis.
29/11/2017, 00:31 - The Dark Knight: Got it. iPhone fuckers. 😝.
29/11/2017, 00:32 - The Dark Knight: I'm off to sleep now, bro.

29/11/2017, 07:12 - Abdul Bhaiya: But at that time (some what around 8-30)my phone will be busy like hell with her calls.
29/11/2017, 07:13 - The Dark Knight: DP change kr bhi lo ab. :p.
29/11/2017, 07:13 - The Dark Knight: Oh okay. Then I won't call.
29/11/2017, 07:13 - Abdul Bhaiya: Need a system for that.
29/11/2017, 07:14 - Abdul Bhaiya: I tried opening her fb account from my phone but not able to find that cricket event pics with my dad.
And apparently I don’t have it with me.
29/11/2017, 07:15 - The Dark Knight: Bwahahaha. 😂.
29/11/2017, 07:15 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😅😅
29/11/2017, 07:16 - Abdul Bhaiya: Not so photogenic bro.
So I hardly have any pic in which I am looking even above average.
😔😔
29/11/2017, 07:16 - The Dark Knight: Koi bhi colour ka DP lgalo with "Abdul" written on it.

Or go with "Begani shaadi m *Abdul*lah deewana". 😜.
29/11/2017, 07:16 - The Dark Knight: Kidding.
29/11/2017, 07:17 - Abdul Bhaiya: Awesome idea!

29/11/2017, 07:20 - The Dark Knight: A "Hi", "Chutiye",etc would do. 😝.
29/11/2017, 07:20 - Abdul Bhaiya: Only with you not with everyone.

29/11/2017, 07:21 - Abdul Bhaiya: 👍🏻👍🏻
30/11/2017, 16:06 - Abdul Bhaiya: I have better ideas for the ugliest competition.
30/11/2017, 16:18 - The Dark Knight: Next time it'll be something else. :p.

30/11/2017, 16:22 - The Dark Knight: Bwahahaha. 😂.
Next time dance pe hoga debate.
30/11/2017, 16:24 - Abdul Bhaiya: But sale wo jada ho jayega.
You literally have to dance and probably you will get other people attention.
30/11/2017, 16:25 - The Dark Knight: That'll be awesome in my opinion.
We'll. Don't worry.
We might end up making a few friends. :p.

(But no, my reason to do this is to cut this societal inhibition and have a blast.).
30/11/2017, 16:29 - Abdul Bhaiya: But itna extreme in just 2nd attempt.
Jada hi ho jaye ga.
Anyways I’m up for it but Tera bharosa nhi.
Plus I gotta redeem my looks.
30/11/2017, 16:29 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😝😝😝
30/11/2017, 17:46 - Abdul Bhaiya: By the way score is 1-0.
😎😎😎
30/11/2017, 17:49 - Abdul Bhaiya: Whoever reaches 10 first he will win the tournament.
We will decide the winning prize later with some mutual understanding.
It have to be grand.
30/11/2017, 17:50 - Abdul Bhaiya: Plus we will have individual tasks too.
Let me know if you are up for it.
30/11/2017, 17:50 - Abdul Bhaiya: *let me know if you are man enough to be up for it.

30/11/2017, 21:55 - Abdul Bhaiya: Bro I loved her so much.
30/11/2017, 21:55 - Abdul Bhaiya: Feeling like unblocking her and tell her to come back to me.
30/11/2017, 21:56 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😢😢😢😢

30/11/2017, 22:01 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😔😔
30/11/2017, 22:01 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😞
30/11/2017, 22:01 - Abdul Bhaiya: Meri jaan nikali raand.
30/11/2017, 22:01 - The Dark Knight: Yaad karo kal kya hua. Simple.
30/11/2017, 22:02 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😞😡😡
30/11/2017, 22:02 - The Dark Knight: Cry me a river sunlo.
30/11/2017, 22:03 - Abdul Bhaiya: Ok.
I have decided bro gotta improve my English and gotta learn guitar.
30/11/2017, 22:03 - Abdul Bhaiya: Teri wali ne kya bola.
30/11/2017, 22:04 - The Dark Knight: You're gonna learn guitar?! :D. Awesome, man!
30/11/2017, 22:07 - The Dark Knight: Kuch nhi.
But bro, I feel like I've cheated on her (my friend).
Seriously bta rha hu, aajtak Abhishek Varma made himself "fall" for girls. But iske saath it happened. There was nothing forced. But mei late ho gya. I'll have to live with this fact.
I'm happy that she's still my family. Utna m hi meri life kat jaegi achhese.
01/12/2017, 06:05 - Abdul Bhaiya: Kya hua call kiya tha.
Mai soo gaya tha.
01/12/2017, 06:13 - Abdul Bhaiya: First I need to buy a guitar 🎸.
Once I’ll buy it I hope I’ll do justice with it.
This is the new change that I have planned to bring in my life.
01/12/2017, 06:13 - Abdul Bhaiya: Bro from my tuta futa experience I can assure you that if both of you loved each other then its going to happen. You let her go if she really loves you she will come back to you(like I did for Pooja).
And also you haven’t cheated on her.
There wasn’t any thing between you guys (love relationship which requires commitment)for which you’ll cheat on her. So just relax.
01/12/2017, 09:04 - The Dark Knight: Thanks. Those words were comforting. :).
01/12/2017, 09:10 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😊😊😊
01/12/2017, 09:10 - The Dark Knight: Guitar kab le rhe ho?
01/12/2017, 09:11 - Abdul Bhaiya: In gym.
On the road to recover my fucked up back!
01/12/2017, 09:11 - The Dark Knight: Awesome, bro! 😄.
01/12/2017, 09:12 - Abdul Bhaiya: Shayed next month salary.

01/12/2017, 09:13 - Abdul Bhaiya: If you ignore my love handles then I must say have sexy abs.
With belly fat.
01/12/2017, 09:13 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😂😂😂😂
01/12/2017, 09:14 - Abdul Bhaiya: Gifted abs I must say!
01/12/2017, 09:14 - The Dark Knight: Waves of jealousy. 😝.
Behenchod! Khuda bhi kaise kaise meherban hota h. 😝.
01/12/2017, 09:14 - The Dark Knight: Seriously!

01/12/2017, 09:14 - Abdul Bhaiya: Really!!!
01/12/2017, 09:14 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😂😂😂😂
01/12/2017, 09:15 - The Dark Knight: If I were you I'd work on eliminating those abdominal fat.
01/12/2017, 09:15 - Abdul Bhaiya: I still really wonder ki aisa chamatkar kaise hua?🤔🤔🤔
01/12/2017, 09:16 - Abdul Bhaiya: Trying hard to do that.😎😎😎
01/12/2017, 09:16 - The Dark Knight: Jis cheez ko dekhne k kiye log itna tadapte h, aapko free fund m de diya! 😝👍🏻.
01/12/2017, 09:17 - Abdul Bhaiya: I know seriously me.🤣🤣🤣
01/12/2017, 09:17 - Abdul Bhaiya: And that’s why my back ki lag gayi because I never focus on my abdominal.
01/12/2017, 09:18 - The Dark Knight: Isbar legs pe bhi focus.
01/12/2017, 09:18 - Abdul Bhaiya: Fokat k abs aise hi mil gaye.
01/12/2017, 09:18 - Abdul Bhaiya: Sure👍🏻👍🏻
01/12/2017, 09:18 - Abdul Bhaiya: Chal nahane jata hu mai.
01/12/2017, 09:18 - The Dark Knight: 👍🏻
01/12/2017, 09:18 - The Dark Knight: Bye.
01/12/2017, 15:29 - Abdul Bhaiya: Bhai maal pr fielding kr raha hu.
Bahut sahi h wo.
Maal lag rahi h.
But I am in info security fest and she was one of the performers but she did only one line in her teams act.
01/12/2017, 15:30 - Abdul Bhaiya: Now wondering ki kya balu.
01/12/2017, 15:30 - Abdul Bhaiya: Can’t say you did great as her stage time was nothing.
01/12/2017, 15:31 - The Dark Knight: Agar sundar dikhti h th usiko leke bol do. 😅. Dress achha lga, etc.
01/12/2017, 15:31 - Abdul Bhaiya: Plus area is bit crowded and it can be noticed by other people.
01/12/2017, 15:32 - Abdul Bhaiya: Wearing jeans and blue jacket.
01/12/2017, 15:33 - Abdul Bhaiya: Dress bada tadkila badhkila lag raha h.
Model type figure h.
😍😍😍😍😋😋😋
01/12/2017, 15:33 - The Dark Knight: Boldo ki you liked her dressing sense. Say ki that compelled you to walk up to her and let her know. Then introduce yourself and start. :p.
01/12/2017, 15:34 - Abdul Bhaiya: Yaha pr wo admin h jo girls ki security ko dekhti h.
01/12/2017, 15:34 - Abdul Bhaiya: So it’s also bit risky too.
01/12/2017, 15:35 - The Dark Knight: Lol. 😂.
01/12/2017, 15:36 - Abdul Bhaiya: That admin comes in my bus that’s how I know her.
01/12/2017, 15:36 - Abdul Bhaiya: She is acting as judge right now.
01/12/2017, 15:36 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😑😑😑
01/12/2017, 15:47 - Abdul Bhaiya: Kya karu bro.
01/12/2017, 15:48 - Abdul Bhaiya: Ye pagal Kiran thik se line tak nhi maarne de raha h.
01/12/2017, 15:49 - Abdul Bhaiya: Her group me ek ek maal toh h hi.
01/12/2017, 15:49 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😋😋😋
01/12/2017, 15:50 - Abdul Bhaiya: And Abhi jis group ka chal raha h us me maal ka naam Pooja h.😢😢😢
01/12/2017, 17:12 - Abdul Bhaiya: Chal tu padh le.
01/12/2017, 17:15 - Abdul Bhaiya: Aj thoda sa popet ho gaya.
Rule1- if a girl says no with less interest then don’t approach again.
😔😔😔
01/12/2017, 20:02 - The Dark Knight: Bwahahaha. XD.
01/12/2017, 20:02 - The Dark Knight: Of course! 😝
01/12/2017, 20:06 - The Dark Knight: <Media omitted>
01/12/2017, 20:38 - Abdul Bhaiya: Nice.
But I was wondering how you come up with this?🤔🤔
I mean this looks simple as well as complex at the same time.
01/12/2017, 20:39 - Abdul Bhaiya: Plus hats off bro.
Really impressive!👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
01/12/2017, 20:54 - Abdul Bhaiya: IMG-20171201-WA0003.jpg (file attached)
01/12/2017, 20:55 - Abdul Bhaiya: This is the reason why I am getting fat these days.
01/12/2017, 20:57 - Abdul Bhaiya: IMG-20171201-WA0004.jpg (file attached)
Finally the most awaited stuff is here. Hope this’ll bring the needed change in me.

01/12/2017, 21:03 - Abdul Bhaiya: Yaar ye toh intermediate walo k liye h.
Fuck!!!!
😔😔😔😔
01/12/2017, 21:04 - Abdul Bhaiya: So much excited I was about this.😞😞😞
01/12/2017, 21:05 - The Dark Knight: You're at an intermediate level. Beginner bole th woh jo English ki 'E' ka vertical line bhi nhi jante.
Kholo book aur shuru ho jao.
01/12/2017, 21:05 - The Dark Knight: 👍🏻
01/12/2017, 21:05 - Abdul Bhaiya: He not even talking about verb, noun, pronouns and other stuff.😞😞😞
01/12/2017, 21:07 - Abdul Bhaiya: I did that and I really needed to start from that level itself.
Although I speak pretty good English but I really suck at it .
I mean I really have no idea what is noun and other stuff.
01/12/2017, 21:08 - Abdul Bhaiya: It’s like you can speak Hindi but you can’t become Hindi teacher because you need to know basics like subject and blah blah blah.
01/12/2017, 21:10 - Abdul Bhaiya: Well I am left with no other option I gotta start from net first and then I’ll move to this book.
01/12/2017, 21:18 - Abdul Bhaiya: Tune Pooja k sath koi movie dekhi thi kya?
01/12/2017, 21:55 - The Dark Knight: Why?
01/12/2017, 21:55 - The Dark Knight: Nhi dekhi. Thank God! Us stage tak nhi pohochi baat.
01/12/2017, 22:02 - Abdul Bhaiya: Actually I have planned to watch movie with her.(justice league)
But wo sab hone se phele ye sab ho gaya.😢😢😔😔
01/12/2017, 22:04 - Abdul Bhaiya: Meri jaan thi yaar wo.
I really loved her a lot.
Still love her.
She really was my life.
Kash usne aisa na kiya hota.😔😔😔😔
01/12/2017, 22:22 - Abdul Bhaiya: IMG-20171201-WA0008.jpg (file attached)
Wondering how the hell YouTube come to know about impractical jokers.
01/12/2017, 22:45 - The Dark Knight: Because we watched it from your gmail account.
01/12/2017, 22:46 - The Dark Knight: "Still"?! 😳
Okay. I'm speechless.
😂
02/12/2017, 17:24 - Abdul Bhaiya: Well that girl (yesterday’s girl to whom I approached)was beautiful I have to give it to her.
Still I can recall her face which quite rare given my weak memory.
02/12/2017, 17:24 - Abdul Bhaiya: *which is
02/12/2017, 17:27 - Abdul Bhaiya: I should have taken the marathali route.😔😔😔
02/12/2017, 17:28 - Abdul Bhaiya: This route(hudi) sucks big time.
02/12/2017, 17:30 - The Dark Knight: I'm geographically challenged. Marathahalli is all I know. 😅
02/12/2017, 17:30 - Abdul Bhaiya: Do you know Phoenix mall?
02/12/2017, 17:31 - The Dark Knight: Yeah. Got it. :p.
It seems like a fine route to me. Straight.
02/12/2017, 17:32 - Abdul Bhaiya: That’s what I thought!
Metro construction causing hell lot of jam.😔😞😑
02/12/2017, 17:35 - Abdul Bhaiya: Shit it started raining.😑😑😑
02/12/2017, 17:39 - Abdul Bhaiya: This route was a real stupid move.
02/12/2017, 17:43 - The Dark Knight: Oh yeah! That makes sense.
Actually it's not the metro construction which is causing the jam (I mean not directly at least (keeping in mind it's Saturday! )). Comic con is being held at KTPO. :p.
02/12/2017, 17:44 - Abdul Bhaiya: KTPO? Where’s that?
02/12/2017, 17:44 - The Dark Knight: A stop before Vydehi and after iGate.
02/12/2017, 17:45 - The Dark Knight: So, all the best. xD.
02/12/2017, 17:45 - Abdul Bhaiya: No !
So you are telling I am going to get fucked now!
02/12/2017, 17:46 - Abdul Bhaiya: I am near sjr now!
02/12/2017, 17:47 - The Dark Knight: Nice. Witness the wrath of comic con + unplanned Whitefield's metro construction + (of course! ) Bangalore's traffic.
02/12/2017, 17:47 - The Dark Knight: 👍🏻
02/12/2017, 17:47 - Abdul Bhaiya: 😢😢😢
02/12/2017, 17:54 - Abdul Bhaiya: Things are calmer than expected!
02/12/2017, 17:57 - Abdul Bhaiya: Should I get down at cmrit or kundan hali gate?
I have bus pass.
02/12/2017, 17:58 - Abdul Bhaiya: Done!
